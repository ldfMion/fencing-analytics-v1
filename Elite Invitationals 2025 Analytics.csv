Mion,Graham,R,A,A,Missing the tip could be due to hitting with the arm not fully extended yet. Maybe having it a bit more extended at the point of the hit could be better.,08/11/25,,,,

Mion,Morais,R,A,P,Long attack at the end that I tried to parry,09/11/25,,,,
Mion,Morais,R,A,Cc,Fake acceleration to invite counter. It seems like at a long distance he will make a long fast attack and at a short distance he will do a fake acceleration.,09/11/25,,,,

Mion,Baumstein,R,Cc,,I really don’t know why I missed the tip here,09/11/25,,,,
Mion,Baumstein,,cR,P,Should have riposted with disengage; he was ready for the parry. Maybe it was even second intention.,09/11/25,,,,
